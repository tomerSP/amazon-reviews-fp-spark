Functional Core
[X] Implement all data transformations as pure functions.
[X] Use immutable data structures (e.g., case classes, List, Map).
[X] Use currying or partial functions.
[X] Demonstrate function composition.


Apache Spark Usage
[X] Use either the RDD, DataFrame, or DataSet API.
[X] Include at least four different Spark operations (e.g., <map>, <filter>, reduceByKey, <groupBy>, <join>).
[X] Load data from an external source.
[X] Save the results to a file.


Advanced Functional Programming
[X] Include and document at least three of the following techniques:
	[X] A custom combinator.
	[X] Use of closures in Spark transformations.
	[ ] A tail-recursive function for computation.
	[ ] Pattern matching with case classes.
	[X] Functional error handling.

Documentation & Testing
[X] Add inline comments and ScalaDoc to the code.
[X] Use ScalaTest for unit testing.
[X] Clearly separate pure logic from I/O operations.
